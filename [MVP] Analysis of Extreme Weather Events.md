## Analysis of Extreme Weather Events, 1996-2019 (MVP)

As people and governments continue to grapple with the effects of climate change, we are interested in monitoring the frequency and severity of extreme weather events. This information can be useful in anticipating extreme weather events such as wildifires and hurricanes, which in turn can aid evacuation efforts and mobilize relief organizations before too much damage is done.

I'm working with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's [Storm Events Database](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/ftp.jsp). Each row represents a weather event in a different location of the United States and contains information on the date, the number of direct and indirect deaths, crop damage and property damage associated with the event. So, it's possible to observe the impact of climate events spatially and over time.
